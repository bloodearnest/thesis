First of all. I'd like to thank my supervisors Dr Jason Noble and Dr Karim
Djemame, for all their time, effort and knowledge. I'd like to thank the
Biosystems Research Group at the Schoool of Computing, particularly Dan Ladley,
for much insightful discussion and enjoyable comradeship. For supporting me
through the process of completing this thesis, I'd like to thank my fiance
Esther Spademan and my good friend Matthew Ashworth.
