                  How can the motor plans necessary for imitating an
                  action derive from the observation of that: action?
                  Imitation may be based on a mechanism directly
                  matching the observed action onto an internal motor
                  representation of that action ("direct matching
                  hypothesis"). To test this hypothesis, normal human
                  participants were asked to observe and imitate a
                  finger movement and to perform the same movement
                  after spatial or symbolic cues. Brain activity was
                  measured with functional magnetic resonance
                  imaging. If the direct matching hypothesis is
                  correct, there should be areas that become active
                  during finger movement; regardless of how it is
                  evoked, and their activation should increase when
                  the same movement is elicited by the observation of
                  an identical movement made by another
                  individual. Two areas with these properties were
                  found in the left; inferior frontal cortex
                  (opercular region) and the rostral-most region of
                  the right superior parietal lobule.}

                  unknown. That is why scientists developed mice
                  lacking the Thy-1 gene. The knockout mice were
                  normal in every way except one. They failed a test
