\section{Introduction and Overview}

Economics is the study of the allocation of scarce resources between competing
alternate uses. The allocation decision making is distributed amongst the many
interested parties, whether individuals and organisations, with no overall
central control.  It is driven by the availability of a resource (supply) and
the need for that resource (demand). In particular, we are interested in
\emph{microeconomics}, the study of individual traders' behaviour and
interactions, and their aggregated effects. 


We start with a summary of simple economic principles.  There is much published
work within the field of economics, and we focus on focus specifically
on decentralised economic mechanisms. Most real-world and theoretical economic
studies are based on some centralised mechanism, and as such are not directly
relevant to our study. Also covered in this chapter is a look at specific
computational market-based control algorithms that have been developed in the
last 20 years.

\section{Modelling an Economic Market}

The term 'market' is used to describe the interactions of traders trading a
particular commodity. The are many different types of markets, selling many
different products, but the basic principles of a market are well defined. Here
we introduce some key concepts about economic markets, and go on to look at
three key components of a market; the traders who act in the market, the rules
of the market (auction mechanism) and a market place in which the interaction
occurs.  Much of this section has been distilled from
\cite{eco-nicholson00-microeconomics}

\subsection{Supply, Demand, and Market Equilibrium}
\label{SEC:ECON:EQUILIBRIUM}

The basic model of supply and demand is well understood. A larger supply of a
resource than demand for it will lead to the price falling as sellers of the
resource compete with each other by offering lower prices to make a sale.
Likewise, a high demand relative to supply would lead to the price rising as
buyers compete to meet their demand.

A key idea in microeconomics is that of market equilibrium. This is the price
in a market for which the supply and demand are equal, and all supply of a
resource is sold and all demand for that resource is met. Any other price would
result in a surplus or shortfall of resource. The aggregate price of a
transaction in a market will tend towards this point over time. The buyer does
not want to spend any more than necessary to meet their demand, and sellers do
not want to waste their own resources to produce resource that is not needed.
It is an \emph{efficient} market. The further the aggregate price is from the
equilibrium price, the more inefficient the market.

Note that there is not always a equilibrium. Factors governing the nature of
producing the resource, or other outside influences, can result in markets that
have constant shortfall or surplus of resource. TODO: Examples?. 

A particular resource's supply and demand do not remain constant. As they
change, the market price will track the equilibrium price, as this is in the
interests of all traders individually. Thus a market will usually tend towards
this 'optimal' efficiency. 

The rate of change of demand and supply varies in different types of markets.
Some are slow and static with well understood supply and demand models (e.g.
TODO). Others are highly dynamic and volatile (e.g. stock, commodities). This
difference in dynamism leads to many different types of market. A less dynamic
market can use a longer process to agree on a price, for example, while a highly
dynamic market needs to utilise a faster method. See section
\ref{SEC:ECON:AUCTIONS} for more examples.

This concept of an 'optimal' price for a particular supply/demand value is key
in evaluating economic systems, particularly when a market is concerned with
global allocative efficiency, as is the case in Grid systems.


\subsection{Market Traders} 
\label{SEC:ECON:TRADERS}

Traders are the individual agents that participate in the market. A trader has
to decide on a public quote to give to other traders, representing the value at
which the trader is willing to trade. These quotes are communicated to other
traders, and if a trader see a quote that is within there private valuation,
they can accept the quote and exchange goods and money.

In real world markets, traders are people, who make decisions about trading
according to some internal rationale. It is this rationality which has been the
focus of much study and investigation. How does a trader decide what to bid?
What information is available to the trader to make the decision? How does the
trader adapt to changes in demand/supply?

Traders have the following basic characteristics;

\begin{itemize} 
  
  \item{\emph{Self-interested}}

    A trader is fundamentally selfish and interested in its own utility or
    profit.  While traders can cooperate, they do so only to their own
    advantage. No rational trader will knowingly trade at a loss

  \item{\emph{Autonomous}}

    A trader makes its own trading decisions, without the need for a central
    authority. Often some sort of central authority is utilised, but it is not
    essential.

  \item{\emph{Limited resources}} 

    A trader has basic limitations. They have a finite amount of resource to
    sell octr money to purchase resource. If traders had very large resources, an
    economic system would be less necessary.

  \item{\emph{Limited knowledge}}

    The trader only has a limited view of the world: they are not omniscient.
    This view is formed from two main sources; public information that can be
    observed from the actions or communications of other traders, or is
    provided by a central arbiter, and private information, such as their own
    resources or valuation of a resource.

  \item{\emph{A rationale}}

    Traders have some way of using the information that they have to estimate
    the market price and formulate a price to quote at. This can be modelled
    mathematically for a mathematical model, or algorithmically for an agent
    based one, and can range from the simple (e.g. constant valuation) to
    highly complex (see \ref{SEC:ECON:COMP_AGENTS})

\end{itemize}

It is these characteristics that lend the trader metaphor to the grid
environment, as there are many similarities between traders and resources and
jobs, particularly in the self-interest of traders, jobs and resources.



\subsection{Auctions}
\label{SEC:ECON:AUCTIONS}

An auction is a set of well understood rules or conventions by which to
communicate quotes between traders and reach a price. Many forms have arisen
over time that have varying characteristics as needed by a particular situation
or market. The main recognised auction types, and the way in which they vary,
are summarised below. Much of this review is based on
\cite{eco-klemperer99-auction}.

\subsubsection{Classical Auctions}

There are four 'classical' auction types recognised in the literature, each
involving a single seller, and multiple buyers, or vice-versa.

\begin{itemize}

  \item \emph{English}
    An English auction is one of the most commonly recognised auction mechanisms.
    It is a public auction with a single seller selling a single resource and multiple
    competing buyers. The buyers start quoting low and raise the quote until no
    other buyer is willing to quote higher. The buyer with the highest quote wins the
    auction.  Often a central independent 'auctioneer' is used to controls the quote
    rises. The advantage of an English auction is that it gets the highest price for the
    seller. It is commonly used for very scarce and unique resources such as
    objects d'art and large houses. In other words, high demand and low supply.

  \item \emph{Dutch}\\
    A Dutch auction is similar to the English auction in that there is a single
    seller and multiple buyers, but the quoting is reversed. The seller starts high
    and then repeatedly lowers the quote until the first buyer accepts the price.
    It is very fast auction and is utilised in flower markets where speed is of the
    essence.

  \item \emph{Sealed-bid}\\
    In sealed-bid auctions the traders submit private
    quotes to a single opposing trader, who is a buyer with many sellers or
    vice verse. The best quote (highest or lowest, depending on whether buying
    or selling) wins the auction. Government contracts commonly use this form.
    A variations of this is to make the bidding iterative in rounds, whith the
    best bid of each round being communicated between rounds. 

  \item \emph{Vickery}\\
    The Vickery auction, or second price auction, is the same as a
    sealed-bid auction, where the best bidder wins the auction, but at the
    price of the second best bidder. This is semantically equivalent to an English
    auction, where the best price is not actually quoted, the winner wins when
    they offers just above the maximum price of the second best bidder.

\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Other Auction Mechanisms}

Retail auctions, or posted price auctions, are the most common, being used in
most western consumer markets. The seller posts a price, and the buyer accepts or
not, take it or leave it.  The seller adjust the posted price occasionally.
This is used in high volume markets with low dynamics and is very scalable.
A local supermarket is a prime example.

\subsubsection{Double Auctions}

A double auction is one where both buyers and sellers quote. The previous
markets are 'single' auctions in this sense, as only the buyer or seller
quotes, not both.  The most common form of this auction is a continuous double
auction. This is a many-to-many auction, commonly used in stock market trading
until the recently, when the advent of computing allowed more efficient
mechanisms to be used. Such auctions occur in a shared common space, where a
trader will shout out his quote, while simultaneously listening to quotes from
both other buyers and sellers. He then adjusts his quote according to what he
hears until his price meets that of an opposing trader and a trade is made.
This has the advantage of being efficient in the sense of fast adaption to the
market equilibrium. It is used in highly dynamic markets such as stocks and
commodities. A common stipulation, often called the New York Stock Exchange
rule after its origin, requires that a quote persists after being given, and
subsequent quotes must improve on that quote.

\subsubsection{Summary}

Many different auctions exist, and can very in different ways:

\begin{itemize}
\item quotes can be private or public.
  \item quotes be communicated simultaneously or continuously
\item quotes can be given by the buyers, sellers or both
\item the number of quotes allowed can vary
\item the number of participants: one-to-one/one-to-many/many-to-many
\end{itemize}

For our work, we will need auction mechanisms that can be decentralised, and
are suited to the Grid environment.


\subsection{Terminology}

For the rest of this thesis, the following terms as defined as described below.

quote: a price offered from one trader to another for an amount of resource

bid: a price offered by a buyer to a seller

offer: a price offered by a seller to a buyer

transaction: a trade between two traders at an agreed on price

market price: the current aggregate price of a transaction.

equilibrium price: the theoretical price where supply and demand meet and the

\section{Computational Economics}

The basic equilibrium model described is section \ref{SEC:ECON:EQUILIBRIUM}
above is tried and tested, and used frequently in the study of market behaviour
and dynamics. It lends itself to the mathematical modelling of markets, where
supply and demand functions can be specified and the model's equations solved
to provide results. This has been the dominant form of modelling markets in the
field of economics. However, many of these mathematical models have had to make
assumptions about the market to retain mathematical tractability.  For
instance, they may assume perfect rationality on the part of traders, or a
perfectly random communication between traders.  It often requires fixed
supply/demand curves, and thus it is difficult to individual model agents'
adaption to changing market conditions.  This is very much a 'top-down' model,
attempting the capture the entire behaviour of a system in concrete manner.

The field of experimental economics represents a different approach to
understanding markets, established by Vernon Smith in
1962\cite{eco-smith62-competitive}. He created a simple experimental market,
and used real human traders to explore market dynamics. This approach allows
individual trader behaviour to be examined, which the mathematical models do
not.

With the emergence of cheap and accessible computation now available to
researchers, experimental computational modelling has become increasingly
popular in economics during the last 20 years\cite{eco-gode93-zi}. Markets can
actually be fully simulated and traced, and the behaviours of individual
traders defined and examined. This allows us to look at the above assumptions
in great detail, and study more complex questions that were not feasible with
previous models. They can provide more detail about the rich dynamics that can
be present in economic systems.  

This approach is a 'bottom-up' model, as the individual agents give rise to
system-level behaviour. It allows us to observe details like robustness and
individual traders actions, and explore areas that previously infeasible to
examine.


\subsection{Modelling Human Traders}

Every year since 1999, the Trading Agent Competition\cite{eco-wellman99-tac}
has been held as the primary forum for research into trading agents.  The
competition's market is a complex multi-market simulation of a travel and
leisure economy, where traders compete to purchase flights, accommodation and
entertainment as holiday packages.  Successful agents have including
SouthamptonTAC\cite{eco-he05-tada}, and Walverine\cite{eco-cheng05-walverine}.

The paradigm for these agents it a 'top-down' approach to artificial
intelligence. That is, they attempt to capture human thought patterns at a high
level, and develop methods of implementing similar strategies computationally.
This means that the architecture of these agents is often complex and
multi-layered, as human strategies are often complex and intricate.
Additionally, these agents are designed for a specific market that is well
defined and implemented.

Whilst it would be potentially feasible to implement similar algorithms in our
exploratory work, the agents are complex to implement and would require
refactoring to be more general. Therefore, we look to a different approach for
trader rationale than the TAC-orientated algorithms.

\subsection{Simple Trading Agents}

Gode and Sunder\cite{eco-gode93-zi} investigated the effect of rationality in
market performance. They formulated a Zero-Intelligence (ZI) trader model, where
agents bid randomly in a double auction market, with the constraint that
the traders' random bids must be within their limit prices (ZI Constrained, or
ZI-C). They found that even with no bidding strategy, markets with ZI-C traders
still reached equilibrium, and proposed that market structure was a partial
substitute for trader rationality.

Cliff\cite{eco-cliff97-zip} explored ZI traders further, showing market
situations in which ZI-C traders failed to find equilibrium, such as markets
with constant supply or demand curves. He proposed an improved trading
algorithm, called Zero Intelligence Plus, or ZIP traders. ZIP traders use a
simple error descent learning rule to adjust a trader's perceived relative to
their limit price. He found that ZIP traders out performed ZI-C in finding
market equilibrium, and were also able to successfully find equilibrium in the
market environments in which ZI-C traders were unsuccessful. He went on to
further optimise the ZIP algorithm \cite{eco-cliff01-evolution}, including
developing a novel partially-double auction mechanism. 

TODO: IBM (GD)


All the work described above was based on a small double auction markets with
about 20 traders, and all-to-all connections between traders. Whilst simple,
this would not be feasible in a grid setting. Additionally, the bidding was
conducted in distinct rounds and the trading was split into trading days, after
the real-world experimental economics that it was based upon. However, Cliff
found ZIP traders to work in continuous trading environments
\cite{eco-cliff01-days}, which is necessary for use in the grid environment.

\section{Market Based Control}

This section looks at how computer science researchers have previously utilised
economics for system control and allocation.

TODO: review Huberman ``The Ecology of Computation``

TODO: review Clearwater ``Market Based Control''


All the above systems rely on a centralised mechanism for the market to
function.

\section{Existing Grid Economic Models}
\label{SEC:ECON:GRIDECON}

The idea of an economic model for grid computing is not new. A review of
distributed economic systems is presented in\cite{grid-buyya02-economic} Buyya
\textit{et al} outline the various potential auction strategies for a grid
market place, similar to those outlined here, and provides an overview of some
distributed economic allocation systems. Most of these systems are designed for
a specific purpose, and require administrative control over the resources, and
as such are not applicable to a grid system. 

Nimrod/G \cite{grid-buyya00-nimrod-g}\cite{grid-abramson02-nimrod-g} the only
economic system designed specifically for the grid environment.  It allows
users to define a maximum cost and execution deadline, and resources define a
base cost. The scheduler uses MDS to discover potential resources and their
associated costs, and uses a cost-deadline optimisation
algorithm\cite{grid-buyya02-dbc} to select suitable resources.  The cost and
estimated completion time for these resource time is passed back to the user,
who can then adjust their cost or deadline amounts if desired, or accept the
allocation and dispatch the job. The resource prices are set manually by
resource owners based upon their own perception of market demand. It does
support advanced reservation in this way.

Nimrod thus acts as an economic facilitator with humans as the traders, and
effectively a posted price/retail auction mechanism. This has the potential to
scale well, as retail auctions do, but will be less effective in more dynamic
markets, where faster adaptation to changing supply/demand is required.
Additionally, the trader strategy relies on human interaction, and is therefore
is not automatic, and therefore is not as performant or as scalable as
utilising computational agents to automate the bidding process. It is also
based around a centralised resource discovery mechanism (Globus' MDS), which
further limits its scalability.

\section{Summary}

The unique challenges of grid systems present a close match with the challenges
economic systems have evolved to solve, namely a scalable method of allocating
scarce resource amongst self-interested parties. It allows for non-trusting
parties to co-operate in a decentralised and robust manor This suggest the
economics model of allocation as a good fit to the grid allocation problem.
